This directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant technical decisions.

## Naming Convention

```bash
claude /architect "Evaluate [options] for [purpose]"
```

## Template

Each ADR should include:
- Context: What problem are we solving?
- Options Considered: What alternatives exist?
- Decision: What did we choose?
- Consequences: What does this enable/constrain?
