# Session: 2025-12-03

## Accomplished
- **Command suite evaluation**: Conducted comprehensive analysis of all 24 custom commands from a professional/production perspective
- **Educational review**: Identified 15 categories of considerations for transitioning from learning project to production software
- **No code changes**: This was a pure learning/education session focused on understanding gaps and trade-offs
- **Project status assessment**: Confirmed project health (55 tests passing, clean linting, on main branch)

## Decisions Made
- **No immediate action required**: Current command suite is appropriately scoped for a solo learning project
- **Deferred production concerns**: Agreed that most professional/production considerations (CI/CD, monitoring, security scanning) are premature at this stage
- **Future additions identified**: When transitioning to "real use," prioritize:
  1. `/security-check` - Secrets scanning + dependency vulnerabilities
  2. `/package` - Build distributable artifacts
  3. `/profile` - Performance profiling for rendering

## Open Questions
- **Security tooling**: Does `uv` have built-in vulnerability scanning? (Need to research)
- **Cross-platform testing**: How will PyQt6 behavior differ on macOS/Windows vs. Linux development environment?
- **Distribution strategy**: When ready to distribute, what's the best approach for Python desktop apps? (PyInstaller, py2app, etc.)

## Next Session
- [ ] **Start EPUB rendering work** - Issues #17 (architecture) and #18 (implementation)
- [ ] **Choose path**: `/architect` to design rendering layer OR `/study`/`/mentor` to learn PyQt6 first
- [ ] **Consider**: Review existing playground PyQt6 test before architecting
- [ ] **Optional**: Research if `uv` has security/vulnerability scanning built-in

## Learned Today

### Professional Software Considerations
- **15 categories** of production concerns beyond basic dev workflow:
  1. Security & compliance (secrets, licenses, vulnerabilities)
  2. CI/CD alignment (local vs. CI environment parity)
  3. Observability (profiling, logging, metrics)
  4. Database/state management (migrations, backups)
  5. Dependency management at scale
  6. Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
  7. Backward compatibility
  8. Documentation currency
  9. Error recovery & rollback
  10. Team collaboration (future consideration)
  11. Load & stress testing
  12. User data & privacy
  13. Production monitoring
  14. Disaster recovery
  15. Technical debt tracking

### Appropriate Scoping
- **Key insight**: Not all professional practices apply at all stages
- **Learning project priorities**: Code quality, testing, git workflow (✅ have these)
- **Pre-release priorities**: Security scanning, platform testing, backups (add soon)
- **Production priorities**: Monitoring, telemetry, feature flags (defer until needed)
- **YAGNI principle**: Don't over-engineer for hypothetical scenarios

### Command Suite Maturity
- Current commands appropriately focused on:
  - Learning workflows (`/mentor`, `/study`, `/quiz`, `/hint`)
  - Development quality (`/test`, `/code-review`, `/developer`)
  - Git/GitHub operations (comprehensive coverage)
  - Project management (`/pm` as workflow orchestrator)
- Gap analysis useful for understanding future needs without premature optimization

## Project Status Context
- **Current milestone**: Completed EPUB parsing (55 tests, 100% passing)
- **Next milestone**: EPUB rendering MVP (PyQt6 UI implementation)
- **Learning trajectory**: Transitioning from backend (parsing) to frontend (UI/rendering)
- **Spec ready**: `docs/specs/epub-rendering-mvp.md` exists
- **Open issues**: #17 (design), #18 (implement), #16 (future TUI)

## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed

### Section: "Decisions Log"
**Add new entry:**
```markdown
| 2025-12-03 | Command suite scope: Learning-first | Commands appropriately focused on learning and quality for solo project. Production concerns (monitoring, feature flags, etc.) deferred until needed. Security scanning to be added before first "release". | - |
```

### Section: "Current Sprint"
**Update to reflect rendering work ahead:**
```markdown
- [x] EPUB integration testing (COMPLETED - PR #15)
  - [x] Integration tests with real EPUB files
  - [x] Test complete reading workflow
- [ ] **Next steps** (UPDATED)
  - [ ] EPUB rendering architecture (Issue #17)
  - [ ] EPUB rendering MVP implementation (Issue #18)
  - [ ] PyQt6 learning and UI development
```

### Section: "Learning Goals"
**Update PyQt6 status:**
```markdown
- [ ] Be able to write PyQt/UI code from scratch (IN PROGRESS - starting rendering work)
```

## Meta-Observation
This session demonstrated the value of **stepping back to evaluate tooling and process** rather than always pushing forward on features. Understanding the gap between "learning project" and "production software" provides:
1. **Confidence**: Current approach is sound
2. **Roadmap**: Clear understanding of what to add when
3. **Priorities**: Focus on learning and quality now, production concerns later
