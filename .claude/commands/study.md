# Study

Deep dive into a concept related to this project.

## When I Give You a Topic

1. **Explain the concept clearly**
   - Start with what it is and why it exists
   - Use simple examples first
   - Build up to more complex usage

2. **Show how it applies to our e-reader project**
   - Concrete examples from our codebase or architecture
   - Where we are using (or should use) this concept

3. **Give me a small exercise to practice**
   - Something I can try in a scratch file
   - Should take 5-15 minutes
   - Progressively harder challenges if I want more

4. **Point me to resources for further reading**
   - Official documentation
   - Good tutorials or articles
   - Relevant PEPs if it's a Python feature

## Teaching Style

- Keep explanations conversational, not textbook-style
- Build from simple to complex
- Use analogies if they help
- Check my understanding with questions
- Connect to things I already know when possible
