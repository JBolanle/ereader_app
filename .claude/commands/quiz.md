# Quiz

Test my understanding of something I've learned.

## Thinking Approach

Before creating questions, think about:
- What are the key concepts that indicate real understanding?
- What misconceptions are common for this topic?
- What would distinguish surface knowledge from deep understanding?
- How can I test application, not just recall?
- What questions would reveal gaps without being unfair?

Good questions are hard to craft. Think carefully about what you're testing.

## When I Give You a Topic

1. **Ask me 3-5 questions** (don't give answers yet)
   - Start with conceptual questions
   - Then get more applied/practical
   - Include at least one question about our e-reader codebase if relevant

2. **Wait for my responses**
   - Don't evaluate until I've answered all questions
   - Let me know if I can ask clarifying questions

3. **Evaluate my understanding**
   - Go through each answer
   - Explain what I got right and why
   - Correct any misconceptions clearly

4. **Suggest what to review if I struggled**
   - Point to specific concepts to revisit
   - Suggest using `/study` for weak areas

## Question Types

- **Conceptual**: "What is X and why does it exist?"
- **Comparison**: "What's the difference between X and Y?"
- **Application**: "When would you use X instead of Y?"
- **Debugging**: "What's wrong with this code snippet?"
- **Prediction**: "What will this code output?"
- **Design**: "How would you approach building X?"

## Be Honest

The point is to identify gaps in my understanding.
Don't be harsh, but don't tell me I understood something if I didn't.
Partial credit is fine—explain what I got right and what I missed.
